Analysis of Sales Methods for New Product Line

The goal is to analyse the dataset to break down the sales approaches and assess what would be the best use for a new product line launching.
Main questions are:
- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- Based on the data, which method would be best for the company to continue to use? Some
of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best
to use if the results are similar.
